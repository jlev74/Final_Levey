		 <h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>The prices for concessions are expensive when going to a sporting event. At a baseball game, a hotdog can be up to $6-7, and a meal with fries can cost $12. Budgeting can then become difficult. But, what can cost fans the most is buying beer when they don't know how much one costs.</p>

							<h2><strong>Background and Interview</strong></h2>
						<p class="background">The beer prices can be influenced by the success of the team as when more fans come to the ballpark, the more revenure that the team can generate by increasing the price. In 2018, the World Series champion Boston Red Sox charged fans $8 for a bee; which is the fifth highest price for a beer that season. The Red Sox had a record of 108-54 that year. Another example is the pricing of the Miami Marlins. In 2012, the team's new ballpark opened up, causing the beer prices to be higher at $8, even though the team finished in last place. As the years went on, the team's play improved as they finished in 3rd place in 2015 and 2016, with the best season being in 2017 where they finished in 2nd place at 77-85 (baseball-reference). Howver, the team went to rebuilding in 2018 when they finished in last place, and the beer price dropped to $6. On the opposite side of success, the Chicago Cubs were in the playoffs every year from 2015-2020. At the same time of their success, the Cubs were completing renovations around their stadium, so the team needed more revenue. The combination of success on the field and renovations contributed to the higher beer prices at the stadium.</p>

						<p class="background">The ultimate decision of what a beer costs comes down to the stadium themselves, or the retailer of who sells the beer. The Consumer Affairs Department for Molson Coors said in an email, "our company does not set the final price at retail. Different distributors and retailers can sell their products at the prices they believe are competitive." However, when it comes to market size, larger markets tend to set the higher prices. The most expensive beer was during the 2018 season when the Mets charged $10.50. Playing in New York, the Mets are in the largest market. Matt with the San Francisco Giants said in an email, "the cost of wages and prices of food/drinks at live entertainment are often marked up for profit as people will be willing to pay that money at a live event." For the MLB teams, marking up the prices is seen as a competitive price as they want to make the most profit, while also having it be a price that fans will still spend money on.</p> </div>

						<h2 id="paragraph"> Findings</h2>
							<p class="findings">According to njonlinegambling.com, fans of the Chicago Whitesox drink the most beer with an average of 4.2 beers per game. The same site found that the Whitesox have the 3rd biggest pregamers (drinking before the game starts) and the most lightweight drinkers (miss parts of the game from drinking too much). Even though Whitesox fans may drink the most, they do not spend the most money on beer at a ballgame. The same report from njonlinegambling.com said that Mets fans spend the most on beer with an average of $53. Found above in the story that the Mets have the highest price per beer. </p>

						<p class="findings"> When spending money on beer at the ballpark, fans have a wide array of which brand to choose from. Over the years, IPAs and craft brews have become more popular. According to insidehook.com, the Seattle Mariners have the most craft beer options at their ballpark, followed by the Padres and the Whitesox. The Giants, Kansas City Royals, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Guardians, Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers and Detroit Tigers round out the top 10. 6 of the 10 teams in terms of craft beer options are American league teams, with all five American League central teams being included. However, even with the more beer options, National League ballparks average the higher cost per beer. Small market teams are the ones that sell more craft beers. Aside from the Whitesox and Giants, the markets of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee, San Diego are all considered small market (Bleacher Report). These small market teams sell beer at a lower cost than the larger market teams.</p>

</script>


						<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
							<p class="background"> When going to the ballpark, fans should be prepared for an upsell in prices of food and drink because the sellers know that fans would pay whatever the price is. As a fan thinking about where to watch a game with a budget, consider a small market, American League team as the beer prices tend to be lower, and have a pretty good variety of beers to choose from. Success and market size do play a role in pricing as the better a team is performing, the higher the beer price goes. And market size tends to sell for more money as the large markets spend more moeny and need to make more profit.</p>
